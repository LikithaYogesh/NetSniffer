# NetSniffer

NetSniffer is a simple Python-based tool that scans and discovers hosts (IPs) on a given network and identifies open ports on each host. It utilizes standard libraries like socket and ipaddress to perform network discovery and port scanning.
Features

Host Discovery: Discovers active hosts in a specified network using simple TCP ping (on port 80).
Port Scanning: Scans each discovered host for open ports within a specified range (default: ports 1-1024).
Network Exploration: Efficiently checks a local network for available services.

# Requirements

Python 3.x (No external libraries required, as it uses Python's standard libraries).

# Installation

Clone the repository or download the Python script.

     git clone https://github.com/LikithaYogesh/NetSniffer.git
     cd NetSniffer

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can verify by running:

    python --version

    No external dependencies are needed, as the script only requires Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries (socket, ipaddress).

# Usage

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using Python:

    python netsniffer.py

Enter the network you want to scan in CIDR format (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Example:

Enter the network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24): 192.168.1.0/24

The program will discover active hosts and attempt to identify open ports (default range: 1-1024).

Example output:

Scanning network 192.168.1.0/24 for active hosts...
Discovered hosts: ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2']

Scanning 192.168.1.1 for open ports...
Open ports on 192.168.1.1: [80, 443]

Scanning 192.168.1.2 for open ports...
No open ports found on 192.168.1.2.

# Ethical Considerations

Permission: Ensure you have authorization to scan the network you are targeting. Unauthorized scanning of networks is illegal.
Usage: This tool is intended for use in authorized environments only (e.g., your home network or a network where you have explicit permission).
